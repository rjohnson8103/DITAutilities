# Parse DITA source datasets to analyze their content and scan for possible problems

DITA XML source file datasets contain individual files connected to one another. These Python scripts can be executed in a desktop environment to scan all the .dita and .ditamap files in a directory to report on their content and to find bad file references.

The scripts make used of a set of common functions contained in the file DITAmod.py.
